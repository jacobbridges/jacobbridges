### About me

I am a software engineer, composer, and amateur woodworker. I live in Huntsville with my
wife. We have children.

Across my 16 years of software development, I have built no open source projects of major 
significance. I have started many projects -- and much like this sentence, they remain. However, 
I enjoy browsing the trending lists of Github and seeing other developers have their work
showcased by the algorithm. _Good for them,_ I think to myself while spending another Saturday 
canoing with my unspecified number of children. _One day I will build something like that._

When I'm not indulging my passion for paraphrasing Richard Ayoade, I also enjoy coding.
