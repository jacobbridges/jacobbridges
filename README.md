### About me

I am a software engineer, composer, and amateur woodworker. I live in Huntsville with my
wife. We have children.

Across my 16 years of software development, I have built no open source projects of major 
significance. I have started many projects -- and much like this sentence, they remain. However, 
I enjoy browsing the trending lists of Github and especially enjoy seeing other developers have their work
showcased by the algorithm. _Good for them,_ I think to myself while spending another Saturday 
canoing with my unspecified number of children. _I hope they find meaning and purpose in their 
accomplishment._ And I truly do. Because it's rough out there. Especially when the trending stops.
And you are left with 139 new bug reports and 74 open pull requests. No matter how many stars 
you may or may not have. How good of a friend have you been? Where's the trending list for that?

When I'm not indulging my passion for asking rhetorical questions or paraphrasing Richard Ayoade, I also enjoy coding.
